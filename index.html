    <h1>Hello There! Here is a page all about Matt</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        My father was in the army so I grew up all over the world but have been in the Seattle area for over 20 years so I consider this home. I live with my wonderful wife Jenny and fluffy dog Basha. I have a lot of hobbies and interests (too many if you are asking my wife) and they include but are not limited to: photography, woodworking, backpacking, coffee, beer, wine, cycling, music and vinyl records, DIY/home improvement, and traveling. I've had a number of jobs over the years but the main career path that I'm currently pivoting away from was in the non-profit world (church-pastor). I love learning new things and making new friends.  
    </p>

    <h2>Education History</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Seattle Pacific Seminary - Masters of Divinity
        </li>
        <li>
            Seattle Pacific University - BA in Political Science
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
   <p>
       I'm looking for a stable, challenging, and in-demand career that will encourage me to keep learning and growing my skills. I'm drawn to the idea of working remotely from home or anywhere I want to be. Also I see a lot of need for web development or software development in the non-profit world and I would love to land somewhere doing work to support either environmental justice or advocacy for marginalized peoples.
